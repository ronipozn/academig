When searching for a Ph.D. position, or once already in, but facing the decision whether to join a **graduate program**, there are several points that require consideration. I hope that this overview will help you make the right decision.

First of all, we need to define the two common paths to obtain a Ph.D. in science.

The standard way is the “simple” one, where the supervisor and the university are responsible for setting the guidelines (the courses, the frequency and the number of the committee meetings, etc.) On this path, the time is devoted to research and its accompanying requirements, such as paper-writing.

Another way to obtain a Ph.D., which becomes more and more common in universities, is by joining a graduate program. The popularity of these programs increases due to the significant amount of funding allocated by the government or the university specifically for this purpose. That way, the supervisor benefits from extra money for research expenses and/or the scholarship of the student. In other cases, the graduate program is supported by minimal funds. These programs provide smaller financial benefits, such as covering the costs of students’ travel expenses to conferences. On the other hand, they are usually less demanding.

Overall, the decision to join a graduate program can crucially affect your satisfaction levels during the next years of your life. In order to make a decision, you will first need to take a detailed look at the benefits and drawbacks of the program.

## The pros of a graduate program

### _Financial support_

The aspect of financial benefit has been already mentioned above, but the topic deserves its own limelight. Some graduate programs will not only cover the salary, research expenses, and conference costs but will also pay for scientific training, such as a variety of professional workshops or travel abroad for collaboration with another lab. These opportunities are indispensable for a future career.

### _Visibility_

The graduate programs are advertised online and therefore they are highly visible. This advantage is especially relevant when applying from abroad. The information regarding open positions that are not related to graduate programs is usually advertised internally (if at all). Often, this information is passed by word of mouth and therefore it is unavailable to the majority of students.

### _Structure_

Unlike the time consuming and often devastating process of sending countless emails to professors with inquiries regarding open positions, the application process to the graduate program is structured and clear.

Once you are in the program, this structure can help with organizing the time management of the Ph.D. process. During doctoral studies, the research must be structured in an efficient manner, and the graduate program will make sure to remind you in a form of deadlines for committee meetings, a list of courses to be completed and more.

### _Peers_

Ph.D. is not easy, but besides accepting the obvious, you should not underestimate the power of connections to people in a similar situation. It makes the doctoral process much easier. Unlike the regular Ph.D. program, where everyone’s studying starts at different time points, here, you will find other students starting within the same time frame. In other words, the graduate program assures that you will not go through the doctoral process alone.

This aspect is especially helpful when you are facing issues regarding the regulations of the university, or general concerns associated with moving to a new city or even country. You will always find someone to ask help from and you will not have to figure it all out by yourself. More importantly, you can actually make good friends.

### _International environment_

Graduate programs are accepting a certain amount of international people. If you are applying from abroad, the benefit of this point is evident, but it can also be a plus if you are a “native” student. By joining an international program, you will be able to improve your English skills and to learn to work in a multilingual and international environment, which can be good practice for the future.

### _Opportunities to learn_

The programs provide a variety of training, such as lab rotation (within or outside the country), scientific or career development workshops, soft skills, courses and more.

### _Enriching your CV_

The aforementioned benefits will have a significant contribution to your CV. In addition, the programs will usually offer other “CV enhancing activities” such as opportunities to volunteer for retreat organization, to present the scientific work to laypeople, attend conferences, win prizes, and more. In the end, when looking for a job or a postdoc, these additional CV lines will count.

### _Opens opportunities for academia and industry_

Whether you want to continue in the academic path or search for a job in the industry, the rich CV will make it easier. furthermore, students in the programs are often encouraged to invite guest speakers experienced in one of these fields. This can provide an opportunity for future collaborations.

## The cons of a graduate program

### _Competition_

Some graduate programs are more competitive than others, but overall all of them are in high demand. The stringent requirements and competition will call for a lot of mental strength, and even after getting in, you will never be shielded from disappointment. Eventually, you will need to decide whether all this stress and time are worth it.

### _Cushioning_

The structure, help, and peers are of course important, but they shield you from the reality of the real world. As a postdoc or in leading positions in the industry you will find yourself alone, and you will have to figure out the way on your own. In this manner, the regular way to do a Ph.D. is a better representation of reality.

### _Limited time until graduation_

In the regular Ph.D., the time left until graduation is flexible and depends more on the supervisor than on external guidelines. On the contrary, the graduate programs have (sometimes unrealistic) deadlines which are getting shorter and shorter with new programs. In most of the fields, it will be very difficult to finish a full project within a period of a couple of years. You will need to either compromise the quality of your thesis or stay for a postdoc in the same lab in order to finish the project. The latter is only possible if your supervisor will obtain the necessary funds.

This limitation is not very crucial if your aim is to continue to industry, but it is detrimental if you want to pursue an academic career. When graduating within a period of 3 years, with not even one high impact publication, it will be harder to find a postdoc position. On the other hand, after graduation, the time starts ticking, so staying for a postdoc in the same lab is not ideal. You might get that publication in the end, but you will compromise opportunities for some grants and fellowships, that are restricted to a certain time after graduation.

### _Time-consuming requirements_

All the CV enhancing activities are valuable, but they are also gnawing away at research time and therefore compromising the quality of what you actually here for – doing (hopefully great) research.

Instead of conducting that additional experiment, you will find yourself running to a workshop. Instead of reading that new Nature publication, you are working on a poster for a retreat. It all comes at a cost, and of course, do not forget all the stress caused by the time pressure and extra demands. Your supervisor will probably not care about the mandatory career development workshop but will want to see the results of the experiment. Eventually, you will need to either work extra shifts or improve your rhetoric skills.

### _If you are a part of a well-funded research group some of the benefits are irrelevant_

If your supervisor has money, you will have the opportunity to go to international conferences and attend relevant workshops. In this case, you will need to be more proactive, but you will also be much more flexible.

In the bottom line, I hope that I summarized the main points to make it easier for you to decide what will suit you the most. Choose carefully and read all the small letters, but also remember that all graduate programs are different and in some of them you can get maximal benefits at the lowest costs. Make your calculations wisely. Here is a short summary of guidelines that might help you when considering one of such programs:

*   Get familiar with the program by answering the important questions: Who is the head of the program? Does it have an organized structure? Is there a secretary? Who is funding the program?
*   Make a list of all the requirements to have an overview. Then, place the requirements of the first year on an annual calendar. Consider how much time you will have left for lab work.
*   If it is a completely new program, be extra careful. Make a very detailed inquiry regarding the demands. Especially regarding the time restrictions for finishing.
*   Be sure to talk to several students that graduated with the same program.
*   Inquire or check online (linked-in) about the current employment of the previous graduate students. Does it fit with how you envision your future?
