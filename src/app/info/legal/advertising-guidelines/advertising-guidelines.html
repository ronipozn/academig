<h4><b>3. Rules specific to recruiting on Academig</b></h4>

<p>We want to make sure that you attract the right scientists and fill your open positions, while also offering our Users the best possible application process or recruitment experience. To help achieve these goals, we have some specific rules for recruiting on Academig.</p>

<p>The following rules apply to your Job Posts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Job titles.</b> Your job title should provide a clear and accurate description of the job vacancy being promoted and the scientific area or project it relates to. All job titles should have at least 2 words and 20 characters and the format “Position – Area”, e.g.:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Scientist – Biotechnology</b></li>
      <li><b>PostDoc – Agroecology and Organic Farming</b></li>
      <li><b>Researcher – Dynamic Modeling of Energy Systems</b></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Job description.</b> This is your opportunity to provide further information about the position, for example information about the specific team the successful candidate will join. To help applicants get the level of information they need, your job description must be a minimum of 100 characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Desired skills and experience.</b> This is where you have the opportunity to describe the expected profile of the right candidate, including academic background, required qualifications, and essential or desired skills. Make sure you don’t miss any required skills, as job seekers will be paying extra attention to this section.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>About the employer.</b> Here’s your chance to give applicants a little more information about the employer company or institution, the working environment, and any perks of the job. A good employer description can go a long way in attracting the best candidates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Application deadlines.</b> A Job Post must not list an application deadline that differs from the date that the Job Post will expire on Academig. If your application deadline pre- or post-dates the expiry date of the Job Post, this can confuse candidates and result in them missing the opportunity to apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Application method.</b> Don’t include an email address or link to an external application page in your Job Post, so we can track the applications made through Academig. Tracking your Job Post’s success is just as important to us as it is to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>One positions vacancy per Job Post.</b> You may not promote multiple positions vacancies in one Job Post. You can promote multiple openings for an identical position. You are not allowed to change the position being promoted during a Job Post’s posting.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finding employment opportunities is serious business. We want to offer our Users the best possible experience while using Academig, whether they want to learn about employment opportunities that may be relevant to them, or not.

  <li>Maintain and observe a posted Privacy Policy compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, including any laws applicable to the transfer of personal information of EU residents outside the European Economic Area.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Don’t:</b></p>

  <li>Contact candidates who have opted out of being included in candidate search.</li>

  <li>Discriminate against people based on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, disability, medical, or genetic condition.</li>
  <li>Fail to clearly disclose that a position is for an independent contractor or is part-time, piecework, commission-based, or has otherwise nontraditional working conditions or compensation.</li>
  <li>Recruit for business opportunities that require payments or recruitment of others, or that resemble franchises, multi-level marketing, club memberships, distributorships, or are entirely or almost entirely commission-based.</li>
