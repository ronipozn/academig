    <h2>Conduct ALL Your Academic Research in One Place</h2>

    <p class="lead">Consolidate all your academic analysis to one platform with live labs data.</p>

    Follow these steps to fuel your entire academic research or jump into some popular search templates.

    <b>Step 1: Build a Search to Identify Labs or Services in a Specific Research Fields or Experty:</b>
    Add filters to narrow down your company search based on targeted filters. To do this, click “Companies” on the left-hand navigation. Then, click. Ditch the generic Google search to identify the organizations that meet your ideal criteria.

    <b>Step 2: Track Labs Happenings With Alerts:</b>
    Once you’ve built a search of academic-specific labs and services, save it and personalize your alerts. To do this, click the floppy disk ￼on the upper right-hand corner of a search. Get alerts straight to your inbox when these companies raise money, get acquired, or make the news.

    <b>Step 3: Create a List of Interesting Labs and Services to Track:</b>
    Organize your Academig with custom lists. Save lists on potential prospects to reach out to or leads you’re working. You can build a list in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Add companies from a Search by clicking the checkbox next to a company. Then, select Add to List.</li>
    	<li>Add companies from a Crunchbase profile by clicking ()￼ on the upper right-hand box.</li>
    </ul>

    Jump Into Some Examples.
