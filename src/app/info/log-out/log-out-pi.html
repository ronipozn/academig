            Almost all research groups have a departmental or faculty web page.
            The website usually include basic information about their career, students list, and a list of publications.
            But can you rely solely on this web page for your lab overall web presence?

            <li>You are restricted by the systems and functionality that are permitted on your University website.</li>
          	<li>Technical upgrades and other structural development of your University website can affect your web presence rankings.</li>
          	<li>If you switch jobs, you would lose your old website and all the web presence that you acclimated over the years.</li>
          	<li>Technical support in your university may be limited - both in terms of professionalism and availability.</li>
          </ol>
          Academig solves all these problems and much more.
