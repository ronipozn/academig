      <!-- <h3 class="mt-4">What does the Candidate Filtering Feature entail?</h3>

      <p>Filtering candidates is one of the biggest obstacles and frustrations for many remote companies. Screening through hundreds of remote applicants can feel overwhelming and it often delays the overall hiring timeline.</p>

      <p>With the Candidate Filtering feature selected, you’ll receive manually prioritized batches of applicants 3, 14 and 30 days after posting your job, ensuring you see the right people first.</p>

      <p>All applications from candidates will automatically be emailed to jobs@academig.com.</p>

      <p>A real human (not a bot!) takes a look at your job description, sorts through all of the applicants, and prioritizes them based on the requirements you've indicated.</p>

      <p>Candidates will be filtered on the basis of technical requirements, location, regional restrictions, experience level, etc. Please make sure these requirements are clear so we can filter them effectively! We do not remove any applicants from consideration, we simply prioritize which applicants you should look at first.</p>

      <p>You will receive an email from jobs@academig.com:</p>

      <p><b>First batch - 3 days after posting your job</b></p>
      <p><b>Second batch - 14 days after posting your job</b></p>
      <p><b>Third batch - 30 days after posting your job</b></p>

      <p>All batches will include a document that outlines the candidates’ contact information, the date the application was sent, and of course, the application itself (along with the candidate’s original email).</p>

      <p>If you have any questions or have any feedback, please reach out to support@academig.com.</p> -->

      <!-- TBD -->
      <!-- <h3 class="mt-4">What does the Professional Lab Profile Feature entail?</h3> -->
      <!-- that we will add all the content for your lab profile, such as... see example. -->
      <!-- A real human together with our smart algorithms build your professioanl lab profile, and you will get updates along the way. -->

      <!-- TBD -->
      <!-- <h3 class="mt-4">Lab interview opportunity</h3> -->

      <!-- TBD -->
      <!-- <h3 class="mt-4">Academig cake club</h3> -->

      <h3 class="mt-4"><b>Is there a setup fee for the lab profile?</b></h3>
      <p>There is a setup fee for the lab profile only if you choose the Professional Lab Profile feature.</p>

      <h3><b>Do I need a web host?</b></h3>
      <p>Academig offers you secure and unlimited web hosting.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4"><b>Do lab members have to pay to join a lab profile?</b></h3>
      <p>Absolutely not. Payment is made just for the lab profile itself and for job postings.</p>

      <h3><b>What does it mean to manage lab profile content?</b></h3>
      <p>You optimise your listing by updating your lab description, adding services,
      and highlighting your publications and collaborations to attract attention.</p>

      <h3><b>Do I have to enter my credit card information to build my lab profile?</b></h3>
      <p>No, you can sign up and build you lab profile without providing your credit card details.
      Only if and when you switch to LAB PRO or LAB PRO+ plans, you will be asked for your credit card details.</p>
