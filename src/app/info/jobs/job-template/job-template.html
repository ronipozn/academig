      <h3><b>Tips on creating a successful job posting</b></h3>

      <p>How to transform your job description into a job posting that attract great talent.</p>

      <h3><b>1. Use an accurate and searchable job title</b></h3>

      <p>Using a title like ‚ÄúDesign Unicorn‚Äù may be funny and appealing to some, but your job posting will be left out of search results and you‚Äôll miss out on qualified applicants.</p>

      <p>Job seekers are looking up common keywords and phrases like ‚Äúcontent writer,‚Äù ‚ÄúUX designer,‚Äù and ‚Äúcustomer support specialist.‚Äù</p>

      <h3><b>2. Include an emotive introduction</b></h3>

      <p>What‚Äôs your main hook? Captivate the candidates you‚Äôre looking for by including 3-5 details that they‚Äôll find exciting. What makes the role exciting? Why should they apply to work with and for you?</p>

      <h3><b>3. Describe the ideal candidate you‚Äôre looking for</b></h3>

      <p>First list out the characteristics and soft skills you‚Äôd want in an ideal candidate. This allows applicants to see you‚Äôre wanting to hire an actual human being, not just a robot that checks the boxes for qualifications and requirements.</p>

      <h3><b>4. Tell your lab story</b></h3>

      <p>Who is your company? In a brief paragraph of 3-4 sentences, describe what problem your lab solves, how long you‚Äôve been around, and the lab culture and atmosphere.</p>

      <!-- <p>Here are some questions to help you out:</p> -->

      Some other tips:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Be transparent with your expectations from day one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include your lab communication process. Provide high-level details on how your lab mambers stay in sync.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incorporate relevant keywords in your job posting. Here are a few examples:
          <br>Academic job
          <br>Scholar job
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Because you‚Äôll be receiving a large volume of applicants, including these specific academic details will help inform candidates whether your lab is the right fit for them and filter out the applicants simultaneously.</p>

      <h3><b>5. Provide a clear outline of the responsibilities of the position</b></h3>

      <p>Now that you‚Äôve completely captivated the candidate with compelling information, provide the requirements that are essential to this job. What will their day-to-day look like? Who will they work with? Who will they report to?</p>

      <h3><b>6. Provide a list of requirements</b></h3>

      <p>Here‚Äôs where you list out what you require this candidate to be. Aside from previous experience and education, are they required to be a problem-solver? Collaborator? A keen eye for certain science intuition?</p>

      <h3><b>7. Include lab benefits</b></h3>

      <p>Conferences, funding, special equipment, and more</p>

      <h3><b>8. Break down the application process</b></h3>

      <p>In steps, provide what the process is from when they first apply to when they get hired. This‚Äôll inform the candidates and they won‚Äôt need to contact you wondering, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù</p>

      <h3><b>Handy Academic Hiring Tips:</b></h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Use inclusive language - avoid words like ‚Äúrockstar‚Äù, ‚Äúninja‚Äù, and any other alienating languaging that contains bias</li>
        <li>Flip the language from ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for‚Äù to ‚ÄúYou are‚Äù, so that it‚Äôs more relatable to the candidate</li>
        <li>Format your job listing so that it‚Äôs pleasurable to read (ie. don‚Äôt include a million bullet points in the Requirements section that could be better articulated in your lab profile).</li>
        <li>Get a couple of different eyes on the job listing before pushing it live. Proofread, proofread, edit, proofread, edit, proofread.</li>
        <li>Featuring your job on <u>Academig</u> will give you 5x the exposure and double the tweets. It‚Äôs really the quickest way to hire.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><b>Reasons why your job posting isn‚Äôt getting traction</b></h3>

      <p>On rare occasions, labs have reached out to us wondering why their job listing is receiving a lower than expected amount of applications. Below are common reasons why:</p>

      <h4><b>The job role isn‚Äôt clear</b></h4>

      <p>The job description hasn‚Äôt been fully thought out and they‚Äôre basically looking for a unicorn. For example, combining both theoretical and experimental expert. ü§î Seriously.</p>

      <h4><b>The job posting looks like a bit of a disaster</b></h4>

      <p>The job listing either has too much or too little copy. The formatting is off. The tone of the job listing is trying a bit too hard to sell themselves or feels inauthentic.</p>

      <h4><b>The job posting is lacklustre</b></h4>

      <p>Speaking of tone, a common reason a job listing may not be getting any traction is that it‚Äôs either missing an authentic PI voice or all of the sweet reasons why they‚Äôre a great place to work at. We‚Äôre not just talkin‚Äô benefits and perks, we also mean, what are your lab core values? More and more, job seekers are searching for labs that align with the way they work and think. It‚Äôs a win-win situation, really. Wouldn‚Äôt you want lab members who support your vision, after all? Including this information also helps filter out candidates who may not align with your mission or values.</p>

      <h4><b>The job posting is mistaken for a job description</b></h4>

      <p>A job posting is not the same thing as a job description. Job descriptions communicate the responsibilities and expectations of the role that a company uses internally. Job postings sell the position, your lab, lab members, and why you lab is so awesome. An academic job posting is what should be posted on job boards, like ours! As you guessed it, write your job description first before the job posting.</p>
